## Hello

Have few notes:

- I added normalize.css via npm and installed node-sass
- I added skip to query in server (I tried to implement infinite scroll with pagination)
- about form: I wrote reducer with possibility to add own validation function and error on every input, I didn't style it, just wrote a bit logic
- I spent a bit more than 2 hours because of enjoying

### Have a great time!
